        passage: "I'm Jeff Oliver. I'm 24 years old. I decided to become __(1)__ paramedic when I saw two of __(2)__ treating a driver at the scene of an accident when I __(3)__ a boy. I started as a trainee ambulance __(4)__, and trained for two and a half years to become a __(5)__ paramedic. Now I administer life-saving procedures myself. It's part of my everyday work to defibrillate the heart of a cardiac arrest, to apply splints to limbs and dress wounds, and to set up drips. I have to make __(6)__ decisions – it's an important part of __(7)__ emergency treatment. So is communicating clearly and keeping a clear head in some difficult situations. And situations are often very difficult, especially when we have to deal __(8)__ people __(9)__ the influence of drugs and alcohol. But paramedics don't think twice – we are always first at the scene when there is a suicide, a road accident, or a fire. When you save a life, it's the __(10)__ job in the world.",
